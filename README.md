A not-so-clever pun of my last name and "journal."

Wat
---

I've found my parents hard to shop for, so this is something small I built for them. It pulls photos from my and my sister's Instagram feeds (tagged appropriately).

Also, my parents say a lot of funny things that we'll tweet. So it also pulls their quotes from our Twitter streams.

Why
---

Mostly I haven't really had a chance to play with Twitter's API (since changes) or Instagram's. Also I was bored over break.

So I built this with Sinatra, Mongo, Slim and SCSS. I also want to throw some Redis into the mix.
